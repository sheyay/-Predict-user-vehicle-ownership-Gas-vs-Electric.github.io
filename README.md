 Predict user vehicle ownership: Gas vs Electric

Objective

There were two primary reasons for us on selecting this particular topic:-
Firstly, with increasing gasoline prices, accruing miles behind the wheel every day is also becoming more expensive.
Secondly, with the increase in the environmental impact of vehicle carbon emissions, electric cars can be beneficial for improving air quality in towns and cities. 
In recent decades, Alternative vehicle technologies, such as full electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), have dramatically increased as a strategy to fight the transportation sector's reliance on fossil fuels, and also to focus on preserving the environment.

Problem Statements

Prescriptive analytics:  
Given uncertainties in the future 5-10 years, e.g., work-from-home policy, green energy, subsidies, which to choose: Tesla (or other electric vehicles) versus a specific fuel vehicle for a specific traveler? [Decision analysis].

Goal

To help a consumer decide which car he should buy: Fuel based or Electric based.
